This is <a href='https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/main/CodingChallenges/CC_100.1_NeuroEvolution_FlappyBird'> his repo<a/>

I got the base flappy bird running fine but I got stumped on the genetic algorithm, so I had to grab his selection algorithm as well as his  <a href='./js/nn/matrix.js'>matrix.js<a/> and <a href='./js/nn/nn.js'>nn.js.<a/>

I like how this approach uses neural networks but does not even train them in the traditional sense.
