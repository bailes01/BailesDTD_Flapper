This has been a really fun learning exercise for me. I began by recreating the flappy bird game, if anyone see's this you can probably tell I'm not the most experienced programmer from the code. I then grabbed dan shiffmans matrix.js and nn.js and tried to figure out the genetic selection process myself, it did not go very well so I stole that too.

Since then I picked up "Neural Networks from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley(sentdex) and Daniel Kukiel which is written for python. I decided to try to implement that in javascript main as a challenge but also to force myself to actually learn the math without cutting corners. I am only a few chapters in but It was enough to figure it out considering no training is actually done here.

 I plan on continuing this project just as a fun way to implement what I'm learning. I hope to add ways to customize the game and the neural network. Things like being able to select which inputs are fed to the network or the mutation rate.
